        <ul style="margin: 0 3vw;">
            <li><strong>Special features attempted:</strong> Implementing certain Javascript functions to validate some
                input before sent to server. Also implemented search both ID and status msg in the search function.</li>
            <li><strong>Problems encountered:</strong>Database Setup. System having issue activiating MYSql Service.
                Solved using online resources and AI suggestions.</li>
            <li><strong>What to improve:</strong> Implement Ajax so that could validate duplication for inputs. Also
                could use JS to fetch submit instead of vanilla submit to PHP -- so that the page wouiln't have to be
                reset.</li>
            <li><strong>Learned:</strong> PHP and form handling. Reviewed HTML+CSS. </li>
        </ul>

            <li>No external resources used in this project that needs reference.</li>
            <li>Certain parts of this project is finised under AI suggestions and explainations. Minimum Code Generation
                used with "Tab" prediction for repetitive functions only(details below). Tools involved: Github Copilot
                & ChatGPT</li>
            <li>While the structure of basic Javascript functions are made by myself, similar functions' repetation are
                generated by Github Coppilot's "Tab" prediction feature.</li>
            <li>Majority of CSS stylesheet are done independently. Some visual effects, such as the radio & checkbox
                block effect are achieved with suggestion from AI tools. </li>
            <li>AI Usage during PHP logic development has been kept to a minimum and debugging analysis only. Github
                Co-pilot Tab prediction has been turned off during PHP developments.</li>
